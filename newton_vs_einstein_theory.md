When people say **Newton’s theory treats gravity as a *non-local* force and this leads to paradoxes**, they’re pointing to a deep conceptual problem with *how* gravity works in classical mechanics.

Let’s unpack that carefully.

---

## 1. What “non-local” means in Newtonian gravity

In **Newton’s law of universal gravitation**,

[
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
]

two masses attract each other **instantaneously**, no matter how far apart they are.

* If the Sun were to suddenly disappear,
* the Earth would (according to Newton’s equations) instantly stop orbiting it,
* even though the Sun is ~8 light-minutes away.

That is what *non-local* means here:

> **A change in one place immediately affects another place, with no time delay and no mediating mechanism.**

There is no signal traveling through space. The force just *is*.

## 2. Why this bothered physicists (including Newton)

This idea is called **“action at a distance.”** Newton himself disliked it. In a famous letter, he wrote that it was:

> “so great an absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.”

The discomfort comes from the question:

> **How does one object “know” another object exists, instantly?**

There is:

* no carrier,
* no speed,
* no local interaction.

Just immediate influence.

## 3. The paradoxes it leads to

### A. Instantaneous influence violates causality

If effects happen instantly:

* there is no clear cause-and-effect ordering,
* information could, in principle, travel infinitely fast.

This clashes with later principles of physics, especially:

* **special relativity**, where no influence can exceed the speed of light.

---

### B. Conservation laws become mysterious

Momentum and energy conservation *work mathematically* in Newtonian gravity, but conceptually:

* If Earth pulls on the Sun and the Sun pulls on Earth,
* what *mediates* the exchange of momentum?

With no field, no particles, no propagation, conservation feels like a bookkeeping trick rather than a physical process.

---

### C. No explanation for gravitational changes

If a mass moves:

* when does the gravitational force update elsewhere?
* instantly? everywhere at once?

This leads to logical tension when combined with finite signal speeds in electromagnetism and later relativity.

## 4. How Einstein resolved the problem

**General Relativity replaces non-local force with local geometry.**

Key changes:

* Gravity is **not a force**
* Mass and energy curve spacetime
* Objects move along local geodesics (straightest paths)

Crucially:

* Changes in gravity propagate at the **speed of light**
* Effects are **local**: each point in spacetime responds only to its immediate neighborhood

So:

* No instantaneous action
* No spooky long-distance influence
* No causality violations

---

## 5. Why Newton’s theory still “works”

Despite the paradoxes:

* Newtonian gravity is an **excellent approximation**
* Works when speeds ≪ speed of light
* Works when gravitational fields are weak

That’s why we still use it for:

* engineering
* planetary motion (with small corrections)
* everyday physics

---

## 6. One-sentence summary

> Newtonian gravity is called non-local because it assumes **instantaneous action at a distance**, which creates conceptual paradoxes about causality and physical influence—paradoxes later resolved by Einstein’s local, finite-speed description of gravity in general relativity.

If you want, I can also explain:

* how this compares to quantum non-locality (very different!)
* why fields were such a revolutionary idea
* or how Newtonian gravity can be reformulated in a *field* language to reduce the discomfort

# Simple Summary

Here’s the same idea in **plain, everyday language**:

Newton’s theory says that **objects can pull on each other instantly, no matter how far apart they are**. If something changes in one place, everything else “feels it” right away.

That’s strange because:

* there’s **no messenger** carrying the pull,
* nothing is shown to **travel through space**,
* and the effect happens **with no delay at all**.

This leads to confusing questions like:

* *How does the Earth know the Sun is there?*
* *How can something far away affect you immediately?*

Those are the “paradoxes” people talk about.

Later, Einstein fixed this by saying gravity **doesn’t act instantly**. Instead, space itself changes shape, and those changes **spread at a limited speed (the speed of light)**, which makes cause and effect make sense again.

**In short:**
Newton’s gravity works well, but it feels mysterious because it lets things affect each other instantly across empty space, with no clear explanation of how.
